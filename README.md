# 🚗 Real-Time Dynamic Parking Pricing using Pathway

**IITG Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone**  
*Organized by Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati*

---

## 📈 Overview

**Real-Time Dynamic Parking Pricing** is a capstone project that demonstrates a robust, real-time data streaming pipeline for dynamic parking price computation. Leveraging **Pathway** for stream processing and **Bokeh** for live visualization, this project showcases how modern analytics can optimize urban parking using live occupancy data.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data ingestion and streaming
- Advanced feature engineering on streaming data
- Dynamic pricing based on utilization, demand, peak hours, and surge events
- Interactive, live dashboards for price signals

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/IITG-Summer-Analytics-2025.git
cd IITG-Summer-Analytics-2025


### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install pathway pandas bokeh panel matplotlib

3️⃣ Launch Jupyter:
jupyter notebook


Open `Sample_Notebook.ipynb`, run all cells, and interact with the live streaming visualization.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Simulate live parking occupancy using a CSV file.
- Load with `pandas.read_csv` and stream via `pw.demo.replay_csv`.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Merge `Date` and `Time` into a single `Timestamp`.
- Sort data chronologically.

### 3. Pathway Streaming Pipeline
- Define a `ParkingSchema`.
- Stream and parse timestamps, extract day/hour features.
- Apply **daily tumbling windows** for aggregation.
- Compute daily `occ_max`, `occ_min`, and `capacity`.

### 4. Dynamic Pricing Model
- **Base price:** 5
- **Demand fluctuation:** Scaled by 10
- **Peak hours (8 AM - 6 PM):** +2
- **Surge pricing:** 1.5x multiplier if utilization > 80%
- **Final price:** Dynamically computed and rounded in-stream

### 5. Visualization
- Real-time, interactive price signals using **Bokeh** and **Panel**.

### 6. Execution
- Run the pipeline with `pw.run()`
- Monitor progress in Pathway’s dashboard
- Interact with the live Bokeh plot

## 📊 Results

- **Dynamic pricing pipeline** implemented and validated
- Real-time visualization aligns price with occupancy patterns
- Demonstrates practical use of Pathway streaming for analytics workflows

---

## 🌱 Extending the Project

- Ingest data from multiple parking spots
- Integrate predictive ML models for smarter pricing
- Enhance with weather or event data for richer analytics
